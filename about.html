        <h2 class="page-title">Mission</h2>
        <p>
          This website is a portal to the Great Composers' enduring gift to the
          world. Our love for classical music is the driving force behind this
          endeavor.
        </p>

        <h2 class="page-title">Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The main objective of this website is to present the user the
          catalogued music writen by the great composers. Not their music
          scores, but the listings of their music production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their music is what they left us so that humankind could enjoy a whole
          new world of pure beauty.
        </p>

        <p>
          By searching through the lists of their work we can find a title of
          interest such as a name, an opus number or music category. Then we can
          listen to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we know what we want to hear we can find it in YouTube, buy a cd,
          ask Alexa or Google to play it for us (for example: "Alexa, play
          Chopin Ballade number 1 in G minor," or "Beethoven Opus 111.") Or
          better yet, attend a live performance (there is no electronic
          technology that can match our own ears to capture the realm of the
          sound of music.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of us already know some of the music of the great composers, but
          through these listings you have access to all of it. Furthermore,
          you'll realize that you actually know very little of their music
          compared to the extraordinary number of works produced by the great
          composers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe you can remember famous works of music such as: Johann Sebastian
          Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor for organ, or Mozart's 40th
          Symphony, or one of his piano concertos, or Beethoven's Moonlight
          piano sonata ...
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of us will be surprised to find in these listings that JS Bach
          produced more than 1200 works, among them 241 works for organ. Mozart
          more than 622 works, among them 41 Symphonies and 27 piano concertos.
          Beethoven more than 125 works, among them 32 piano sonatas.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the same way you'll find names of musicians that wrote hundreds of
          works that you were not aware existed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, these pages also provide access to important classical
          music topics. Plus, they greatly facilitate tasks such as gathering
          information and research.
        </p>

        <h2 class="page-title">How it is Done</h2>
        <p>
          By providing links to the internet's already vasts amount of
          information. From were we extract listings of the composer's creative
          works. Most of this information comes from Wikipedia.org.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, a complete list of all the music a given composer ever
          wrote, or the years a composer lived, or lists of composer's
          nationalities, or the mystery behind every professional musician: the
          gift of music or perfect pitch, is now just one click away.
        </p>

        <h2 class="page-title">Additional Information</h2>
        <p>
          Composers listed in the Home and Timeline pages were chosen based on
          the subjective matter of music itself. However, complete lists
          including thousands of composers of all periods of music are found in
          the
          <a href="related.html" title="Related Topics Page">RELATED</a>, page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biographies can be found on the same page; unfortunately, these are
          usually too brief. They provide a rather scarce outline of the lives
          of these remarkable Men and Women.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of their life stories are nothing short of fascinating e.g.,
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevalier_de_Saint-Georges"
            target="_blank"
            >"Chevalier_de_Saint-Georges"</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beethoven's deafness is another such story ... How is it possible
          that, perhaps the most important composer of all time, was completely
          deaf by the time he created his greatest works?
        </p>
        <p>
          Their stories may require further exploration through biographical
          books e.g., "Life of Beethoven" by Romain Rolland; or some remarkable
          films: "Amadeus," "Inmortal Beloved."
