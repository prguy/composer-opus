          <h2 class="page-title">Mission</h2>
          <p>
            This website is a portal to the Great Composers's enduring gift to
            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our love for classical music is the driving force behind this
            endeavor.
          </p>

          <h2 class="page-title">Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            The main objective of this website is to present the user the
            catalogued music writen by the great composers. Not their music
            scores, but the listings of their music production.
            <br />
            Their music is what they left us so that humankind could enjoy a
            whole new world of pure beauty. <br />
            By searching through the lists of their work we can maybe find a
            title of interest such as a name, an opus number or music category.
            Then we can listen it. <br />
            Once we know what we want to hear we can find it in YouTube, buy a
            cd, ask Alexa or Google to play it for us (for example: "Alexa, play
            Chopin Ballade number 1 in G minor," or "Beethoven Opus 111.") Or
            better yet, attend to a live performance concert (there is no
            electronic technology that can match our own ears to capture the
            realm of musical sound.) <br />
            Many of us already know some of the music of the great composers,
            but through these listings you have access to all of it.
            Furthermore, you'll realize that you actually know very little of
            their music compared to the extraordinary number of works produced
            by the great composers. <br />
            Maybe you can remember famous works of music such as: Johann
            Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor for organ, or Mozart's
            40th Symphony, or one of his piano concertos, or Beethoven's
            Moonlight piano sonata ...
            <br />
            Many of us will be surprised to find in these listings that JS Bach
            produced more than 1200 works, among them 241 works for organ.
            Mozart more than 622 works, among them 41 Symphonies and 27 piano
            concertos. Beethoven more than 125 works, among them 32 piano
            sonatas. <br />
            In the same way you'll find new names of musicians that wrote
            hundreds of works you were not aware they existed. <br />
            In addition, these pages also provide access to important classical
            music topics. Plus, they greatly facilitate tasks such as gathering
            information and research.
          </p>

          <h2 class="page-title">How it is Done</h2>
          <p>
            By providing links to the internet's already vasts amount of
            information. From were we extract listings of the composer's
            creative works. Most of this information comes from Wikipedia.org.
            <br />
            For instance, a complete list of all the music a given composer ever
            wrote, or the years a composer lived, or lists of composers
            nationalities, or the mistery behind every professional musician:
            the gift of music or perfect pitch, is now just one click away.
          </p>

          <h2 class="page-title">Additional Information</h2>
          <p>
            Composers listed in the Home and Timeline pages were chosen based on
            the subjective matter of music itself. However, complete lists
            including thousands of composers of all periods of music are found
            in the:
            <a href="related.html" title="Related Topics Page">RELATED</a>,
            page.
            <br />
            Biographies can be found in the same page; unfortunately, these are
            usually too brief. They provide a rather scarce outline of the lives
            of these remarkable Men and Women.
            <br />
            Many of their lives stories are nothing short of fascinating
            e.g.,"Chevalier_de_Saint-Georges."<br />
            Beethoven's deafness is another such story ... How is it possible
            that, perhaps the most important composer of all, was completely
            deaf by the time he created his greatest works?<br />
            Their stories may require further exploring through biographical
            books e.g., "Life of Beethoven" by Romain Rolland; or some
            remarkable films: "Amadeus," "Inmortal Beloved."
